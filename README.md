This project have samplers of various frameworks. It uses Apache Maven, Spring Framework (Annotations), 
Spring Security (Annotations), JSF 2.1, PrimeFaces 5, jQuery, jQuery-UI, underscore.js, lodash, backbone.js,
marionette.js, handlebars.js, boostrap, bootstrap-growl, vis.js, font-awesome, and PrimeUI.

This is a useful for quick lookup on how these frameworks are configured or setup.
